# Jarvis
 
This project aims to develop a Personal Virtual Assistant operated by voice commands.

Jarvis draws its inspiration from virtual assistants like Cortana for Windows, Siri for iOS, Google Assistant for Android & Alexa for Google Home.

It has been designed to provide a user-friendly interface for carrying out a variety of daily-routine tasks.

Users can interact with the assistant through voice commands. As a personal assistant, Jarvis assists the end-user with day-to-day activities like general human conversation,searching queries in google, searching for videos, word meanings, health recommendations based on symptoms and reminding the user about the scheduled events and tasks. 

The user statements/commands areanalyzed with the help python language programming & libraries to give an optimal solution.
